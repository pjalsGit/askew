## What is this?
This is a tool that converts images to ASCII Art.

## How does it work?
Its quite simple, it gets the average of a pixel and maps it to a character.

## How do I use it?
You can run it by installing [Deno](https://deno.land/) and running `deno run --allow-net --allow-read src/main.ts (image) (font)`

## How can I help?
You can contribute to the code by [making a pull request](https://github.com/pjalsGit/askew/issues?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc), or letting me know of issues by [making an issue](https://github.com/pjalsGit/askew/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc).
